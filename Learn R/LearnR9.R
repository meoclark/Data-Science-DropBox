# Method Two: Including Q2

#  Using this second method, we include Q2 in each half.

# sorted [-15,1,20,24,40,45]
dataset_one_q2 <- 4
dataset_two_q2 <- 22

# define the first and third quartile of both datasets here:

dataset_one_q3 <- 7

# INTERQUARTILE RANGE

# The interquartile range (IQR) is a descriptive statistic that tries to solve this problem. 
# The IQR ignores the tails of the dataset, so you know the range around-which your data is centered
# Interquartile is the difference btw first quartile and third quartile

```{r}
# find the first quartile
q1 <- quantile(songs,0.25)
```

```{r}
# calculate the third quartile here:
q3 <- quantile(songs,0.75)
```

```{r}
# calculate the interquartile range here:
interquartile_range <- q3 - q1
```

```{r}

# IQR in R

# The IQR() function takes a dataset as a parameter and returns the Interquartile Range.

```{r}
# create the variable interquartile_range here
interquartile_range <- IQR(songs)
